# Language Translation App

This web application allows users to translate text from one language to another using an external translation API. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Axios.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will run on port 4000.

4. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

5. Select the input and output languages from the dropdown menus.

6. Enter the text you want to translate in the "Enter text to translate..." textarea.

7. Click the "Translate" button to initiate the translation.

8. The translated text will be displayed in the "Your Translated Text Will Appear Here" textarea.

9. Optionally, click the "Copy Text" button to copy the translated text to the clipboard.

## Dependencies

- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the translation API.

## API Configuration

The app uses the [MyMemory Translation Memory API](https://translated-mymemory---translation-memory.p.rapidapi.com/get) for language translation. Ensure you have the required API key for successful requests.

```javascript
// index.js
const apiKey = 'YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY';
const apiHost = 'translated-mymemory---translation-memory.p.rapidapi.com';

// Set your RapidAPI key and host
'X-RapidAPI-Key': apiKey,
'X-RapidAPI-Host': apiHost,
```

## Notes

- The translation API may have usage limitations or restrictions, so be sure to check their documentation.

- This project is a basic implementation and can be enhanced with additional features and improvements.

Feel free to contribute and make this language translation app even more powerful and user-friendly!
